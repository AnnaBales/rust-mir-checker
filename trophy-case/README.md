# üèÜ Trophy Case üèÜ

A showcase of bugs found via statically analyzing Rust codebases by this tool. The template of this page is shamelessly stolen from [rust-fuzz](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/trophy-case).

Most of these bugs are not memory-safety issues which are commonly seen in C and C++ projects. That is because Rust is memory-safe by default!

Memory-safety issues are marked with a ‚ùó in the "Memory-safety?" column. Denial of service, such as panics, is not considered memory-safety issues.
